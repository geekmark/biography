            <p>
                My name is <strong>Mark Adrian Restauro </strong> and most of my friends call me <strong>Mark</strong>. 
                I am studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in ACES Polytechnic College of Panabo City. 
                I am currently at my 2<sup>nd</sup> year in college and this website is part of our activity/exam in Web Development.
                <br><br>During my 1<sup>st</sup> year college we focused on <strong>Java</strong>, an Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), 
                including the first term as a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student. This is one of the reasons why I chose to be an IT 
                because programming is fun and cool. BSIT is actually not my first course during my college times. I studied Bachelor 
                of Science in Marine Biology for two years at Davao del Norte State College in Panabo City. The reason why I stopped it
                because of some personal problems. Basically, it was hard for my parents to send me to school since college is quite
                expensive. Today, I make the most out of it and enjoy the rest of my time on college as an IT student.

            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
                I spend my free time on playing online games, mostly First-Person Shooting(FPS) games like 
                <strong>Valorant, PUBG, Counter Strike: Global Offensive</strong> and <strong>DOTA 2</strong>. I'm not really good at those 
                games like god or pro level since I dont do it for living, I just found it as a gateway to leave the real world for a while. 
                I'm just a casual player who loves to play with friends since most of my friends are also gamers. 
                <br>
                <br>I also like to watch movies on Netflix and I'm not really particular with the genre as long as the movie has a good story. 
                When it comes to sport, I usually play <strong>basketball</strong> and given I'm a tall, big guy it gives me an advantage with 
                my opposing player.
